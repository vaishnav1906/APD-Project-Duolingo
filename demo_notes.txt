# Demo Notes
1. Push a change to GitHub (edit a text in app.js)
2. Jenkins automatically triggers pipeline:
   - Checkout -> Install -> Test -> Deploy
3. App runs on localhost:4000
4. Show GitHub repo and Jenkins dashboard live.

Data Flow: GitHub (code pushed) -> Jenkins (pulls & builds) -> App (runs on server)
